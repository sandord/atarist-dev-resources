## Blogs, wikis, and other resources

- [BUS ERROR Atari 16/32 Bit Development Info Page](https://bus-error.nokturnal.pl/Welcome%2Bto%2BAtari%2Bcoding%2Bwiki%2521)
  - Hase some very useful information about cross compilation and assembly.

## C Programming

C is the primary programming language used for Atari ST development.

- [Makefile tutorial](https://makefiletutorial.com)
  - A very useful guide to writing Makefiles.
- [Object Oriented Programming in C](https://www.state-machine.com/oop)
  - Explains how to implement object-oriented programming concepts in C.
  - The references at the bottom of the page are also very useful.

## Cross compilation

This section contains resources for cross-compiling Atari ST software from other platforms. Developing on the Atari ST itself is often limited by its hardware capabilities and with cross-compilation, you can leverage more powerful development environments.

- [Thorsten Otto's m68k-atari-mint cross-tools page](https://tho-otto.de/crossmint.php)
  - A page full of resources for cross-compiling for the Atari ST using GCC.
- [VBCC](http://sun.hasenbraten.de/vbcc)
  - A highly optimizing portable and retargetable ISO C compiler.
- [Platform Guide: Atari ST](https://bumbershootsoft.wordpress.com/platform-guide-atari-st)
  - A VBCC/VASM oriented guide.

## Books and references
- Atari ST Platform
  - [The Atari Compendium](https://info-coach.fr/atari/software/_development/Atari-Compendium.pdf)
