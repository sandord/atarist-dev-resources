- [BUS ERROR Atari 16/32 Bit Development Info Page](https://bus-error.nokturnal.pl/Welcome%2Bto%2BAtari%2Bcoding%2Bwiki%2521)
  - Has some very useful information about cross compilation and assembly.
- [Beyond Brown](http://beyondbrown.d-bug.me)
 
## General Atari ST websites

- [DrCoolZic Atari ST Site](https://info-coach.fr/atari/index.php)
  - Contains a lot of detailed information about the hardware and software side of the Atari ST.

## Emulators

- [Hatari](https://www.hatari-emu.org)
  - [Hatari User manual](https://www.hatari-emu.org/doc/manual.html)
  - [Hatari Debugger manual](https://www.hatari-emu.org/doc/debugger.html)
- [STeem](https://sourceforge.net/projects/steemsse)

## C Programming

C is the primary programming language used for professional Atari ST development.

- [Makefile tutorial](https://makefiletutorial.com)
  - A very useful guide to writing Makefiles.
- [Object Oriented Programming in C](https://www.state-machine.com/oop)
  - Explains how to implement object-oriented programming concepts in C.
  - The references at the bottom of the page are also very useful.

## Assembly Programming

  - Some very interesting and useful Bugaboo debugger tips and tricks.
- [Cycle counting in the Atari ST](https://pasti.fxatari.com/68kdocs/AtariSTCycleCounting.html)

## Cross compilation

This section contains resources for cross-compiling Atari ST software from other platforms. Developing on the Atari ST itself is often limited by its hardware capabilities and with cross-compilation, you can leverage more powerful development environments.

- [Thorsten Otto's m68k-atari-mint cross-tools page](https://tho-otto.de/crossmint.php)
  - A page full of resources for cross-compiling for the Atari ST using GCC.
- [VBCC](http://sun.hasenbraten.de/vbcc)
  - A highly optimizing portable and retargetable ISO C compiler.
- [Platform Guide: Atari ST](https://bumbershootsoft.wordpress.com/platform-guide-atari-st)
  - A VBCC/VASM oriented guide.
- [M68k LVVM documentation](https://m680x0.github.io/doc)
  - Resources for users of M68k LLVM toolchain.

## Books and references
